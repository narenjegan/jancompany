The shooter must manually reload a single shot rifle after firing every single shot. Its simplistic design means that a single-shot rifle does not need a very large receiver. It also has very few moving parts that could fail. Common types of single shot rifles are the bolt-action, break-action, muzzleloader, and lever-action. Less common types of rifles that are single shot include the rolling block, trapdoor, and drop blocks/falling block.\n" +

A single-shot rifle is also a good choice for teaching a younger shooter, partly because an unintentional discharge cannot fire multiple rounds of ammo.");

Operating a lever action is a great deal of fun and reminiscent of the cowboy days. While a lever action can be handled effectively during combat, it is far from an optimal choice for self-defense.
